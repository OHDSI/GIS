# **GaiaCore**

## Description

Gaia Core is the central functionality and storage of Gaia and consists of two main features: a **staging database** and an **execution engine**.

The staging database is a PostGIS database with a replica copy of the Gaia Catalog installed in a schema named "backbone". In this database, public datasets that are registered in Gaia Catalog can be "staged": transformed and then loaded as tables in a standardized Entity-Attribute-Value format. Other geospatial data, such as geocoded addresses, can also be loaded into the staging database for use in conjunction with the staged data.

All operations on the staging database (creating tables, inserting data, accessing data, etc.) are performed through the "execution engine". The execution engine can be any software package (e.g. R package, Python library, CLI) that connects to the database and functionalizes the logic required to write or read data to and from the standard format.

## Scope

The **ultimate vision** of Gaia Core is support for multiple geospatial databases (particularly cloud-native), as well as execution engine interfaces for multiple popular data science programming languages (e.g. Python, Julia, R, Bash). **Currently**, the staging database has only been implemented in PostGIS and the execution engine has only been implemented in R.
