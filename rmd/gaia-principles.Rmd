# **Preface**

<br> 

## Use Case Simplified

<br>

To oversimplify, our goal is to create a mechanism to locally deploy a geospatial database, standardize the representation of place-related data within, and automate the process of populating data into it. 

Consequently, the foundational goals of our design can be summarized as:

- Extensibility
  - Tooling (via a standard data model)
  - Collaborative growth
  - Integration with ontologies
- Automation
  - Data retrieval, standardization, ingestion 
  - Deployment of stack 
- Efficiency
  - Storage design
  - Centralized functional metadata

# **Schema Overview** 

<br>

There are three distinct portions of our schema:

<br>

- #### Data Source & Variable Metadata
  - contained within **DATA_SOURCE** and **VARIABLE_SOURCE** tables
    - VARIABLE_SOURCE to DATA_SOURCE is a many-to-one relationship
  - both functional and descriptive metadata

<br>


- #### Indexing Tables
  - Contained within **GEOM_INDEX** and **ATTR_INDEX**
  - This provides the functional mapping between the data source and variable definitions to the local place-related data
  - These tables are automatically populated when new data sources are added

<br>


- #### Standardized Place-Related data
  - Contained within **GEOM_*{x}*** and **ATTR_*{x}*** tables (many instances)
  - All place-related data, once ingested, is represented as two tables:
     - Geometries
     - Attributes (of geometries)
  - Each data source is ingested as it's own unique set GEOM and ATTR tables

# **Standardized Place-Related Data**

<br>

## Common Data Model Approach

TODO: rationale

(placeholder)
- enables extensible tooling
- defines specification for functional metadata
  - data sources are structured the same but stored separately 


<br>


## GEOMETRY and ATTRIBUTE

<br>

// TODO 

- make replication clear
- naming conventions
- schema assignment conventions
- geom and/or attr for given data source 




### Transition to EAV design

# **Backbone Schema**

// TODO - 1-2 sentence intro

// TODO - Diagram

<br>

## Data & Variable source metadata 


// TODO: 
- diagram breaking down data_source (retrieval, translation, storage, etc. )
- explain relationship between them; what they contain 

// TODO: Diagram

<br>

## Indexing & Linkages

// TODO
- automatically built by data_source specification
- provides functional mapping to parameterize tooling 

<br> 

---

# **Metadata**

<br>

TODO: purpose/use, etc.

- defined structure

- "recipes"

<br>

## Centralized Repository

- to be hosted centrally
- lightweight
- holds recipes not data 
- mechanism for collaborative growth

## Functional Metadata
