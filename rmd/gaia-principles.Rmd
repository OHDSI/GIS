# **Gaia**

## Design Principles 

### Gaia Core

TODO

 - Lightweight execution engine of/for functional metadata
 - Populates local standardized implementation
< Dependencies Diagram >

### Catalog

TODO
< Diagram Showing interaction with local DB >
 - Centralized
 - Contains the functional metadata instead of source data itself

### Functional Metadata

TODO
 - Show how it changes from wide table to EAV
 - Give examples/breakdown of each of:
   - Data source (geometry)
   - Variable (attribute)


### Storage Design

TODO
< Diagram with connections between backbone tables and templated tables >
 - Backbone
   - Data source; variable source
     < Diagram showing relationships > 
     < 	Diagram showing an example of variables pointing to same data source >
   - Indexing design
    < Diagram >
   - Rationale / How it is functionally referenced
 -	Templates
   < Diagram of relation to each other >
   - Structure of the tables
   - Example of populated tables (subsets of columns) and their relation



### Common Model/ EAV 

TODO

< Diagram showing transition from wide source table to standardized EAV structure >
- What this enables
   - Extensible tooling
   - Efficient querying on smaller tables 
   - (?) integration with ontologies/additional metadata
