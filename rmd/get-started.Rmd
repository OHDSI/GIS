# **Getting Started with Gaia**

For background information on Gaia, see the [Gaia Overview](gaia-intro.html#Overview). For an explanation of the Gaia architecture, see the [Framework Overview](framework.html).

## Installation

To get started with Gaia you'll need to install [gaiaCore (R Package)](gaia-core.html) from GitHub, create a PostGIS database and load the metadata source files, and then connect to the database from your R environment:

<br>

### gaiaCore (R Package)

1. See the instructions [here](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/rSetup.html) for configuring your R environment, including RTools and Java.

2. You can install the latest version of [gaiaCore (R Package)](gaia-core.html) from GitHub with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("OHDSI/GIS")
```

<br>

### PostGIS Database (Catalog and Staging)

Once you have a postgres database with PostGIS installed, the helper script `initialize.sql` in the [inst directory](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/tree/main/inst/) will do the rest of the setup. This includes:

1. Creating a schema named "backbone"
2. Creating the tables described in the [backbone specification](gaia-datamodels.html#Backbone) and sequences for autoincrementing identifiers.
3. Inserting [Gaia Catalog](gaia-catalog.html) metadata (IMPORTANT: script assumes the files './csv/data_source.csv' and './csv/variable_source.csv' exist relative to 'initialize.sql', as they do in the [inst directory](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/tree/main/inst/))
4.Populating the geom_index and attr_index 

### Connecting the Database to R

1. Create a connection from your R environment to the PostGIS database. This can be done using the DatabaseConnector package:

```
library(gaiaCore)

connectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(
  dbms = "postgresql",
  server = "localhost/gaiaDB",
  port = 5432,
  user="postgres",
  password = "mysecretpassword") 
```
