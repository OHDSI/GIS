This checklist is designed to validate new GIS Vocabulary Package releases in OMOP CDM format.

## 4.1. General QA for Core Vocabulary Tables

### 4.1.1 Table Row Counts

Ensure the following delta tables are populated unless explicitly expected to be empty:

- `concept_delta`
- `concept_relationship_delta`
- `concept_synonym_delta` (if synonyms are defined)
- `concept_ancestor_delta` (if hierarchical terms are used)
- `source_to_concept_map` (if supplemental mappings are included)

### 4.1.2 Vocabulary Metadata

- Confirm `vocabulary_delta`, `domain_delta`, `relationship_delta`, and `concept_class_delta` only contain new or modified entries.
- Verify required fields exist (e.g., `vocabulary_id`, `vocabulary_name`, `vocabulary_reference`, etc.).

---

## 4.2. Semantic Consistency Checks

### 4.2.1. Mapping Validity

- Concepts with `standard_concept IS NULL` should have at least one outbound `Maps to` or `Mapped from` relationship.
- Concepts with `standard_concept = 'S'` should not map to other standard concepts unless it's a self-map.
- Non-standard to non-standard mappings are permitted for auxiliary relationships (e.g., `Has geometry`, `Locates in cell`) but must be flagged for review.

### 4.2.2. Duplicate Mappings

- No duplicate `(concept_id_1, relationship_id, concept_id_2)` combinations.
- Multiple `Maps to` targets for the same source must be clinically or hierarchically justified.

### 4.2.3. Invalid Target Concepts

Ensure all `target_concept_id` values from the [source mapping table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMLjKokFCpoDqC_WsAd7ZXyBKDmnPif2rR9DlQ9X7cs/edit?usp=sharing):

- Exist in the current `concept` or `concept_delta` table
- Have `invalid_reason IS NULL`

### 4.2.4. Domain Compatibility

- Detect domain inconsistencies (e.g., source `Procedure` â†’ target `Measurement`) unless justified.
- Validate that concepts in specific GIS domains consistently map to expected domains.

---

## 4.3. Syntactic Integrity

### 4.3.1. Concept Code Naming

- Validate `concept_code` format. Ensure they match declared `source_code` values.

### 4.3.2. Concept Names

- No duplicate `concept_name` entries unless codes differ.
- Avoid placeholder or malformed names.

### 4.3.3. Field Completeness

Ensure these fields are always populated:

- `concept_id`
- `concept_name`
- `domain_id`
- `vocabulary_id` 
- `concept_code` 
- `valid_start_date`
- `valid_end_date`

---

## 4.4. Source Mapping QA

### 4.4.1. Coverage

- Every `source_code` in the source mapping table should exist in `concept_delta`.
- Every `source_description` should match a `concept_name`.
- Every `source_description_synonym` should match a `concept_synonym_name`.

### 4.4.2. Source-to-Concept Map QA

- `source_to_concept_map` must contain complete mappings:
  - `source_code`
  - `source_concept_id`
  - `target_concept_id`

---

## 4.5. Concept Synonym Validation

- Each `concept_synonym_delta` entry must:
  - Reference a valid `concept_id` from `concept_delta`
  - Include a non-empty, distinct `concept_synonym_name`
  - Not duplicate the main `concept_name`
- Cross-check expected synonyms (from source mapping table) are present.

---

## 4.6. Concept Ancestor Integrity

- Ensure all transitive or hierarchical relationships exist in `concept_ancestor_delta`.
- No cycles or broken ancestry chains.
- Confirm taxonomic hierarchies are correctly represented.
- Only standard concept participate in the hierarchy

---

## 4.7. Naming & Formatting Edge Cases

- Validate encoding of Unicode characters.
- Ensure special characters (e.g., brackets, slashes) do not break parsing.
- Detect changes in `concept_name` between source and derived vocabularies.

---

## 4.8. Summary and Reporting

- Provide counts of:
  - New and modified rows per table
  - Failed validations (e.g., invalid mappings, duplicates)
  - Mapping coverage (e.g., `% source codes mapped`)
- Generate a `.csv` or `.md` QA report to accompany the vocabulary release.

> These checks complement automated scripts and should be validated by vocabulary experts and domain specialists, especially for novel environmental or spatial concepts.
