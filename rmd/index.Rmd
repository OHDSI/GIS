# **OHDSI Geographic Informations Systems (GIS) Workgroup Homepage**

## **Mission**

Improve the health of populations by generating reliable evidence from integrated geospatial and person-level health data.

## **Meeting Schedule**

The OHDSI GIS Workgroup meets weekly on **Fridays at 10 AM ET** ([Meeting Link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3af4d776830f504bf3827fe4309156a3c6%40thread.tacv2/1724707871947?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22a30f0094-9120-4aab-ba4c-e5509023b2d5%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22457ee911-94c1-4da2-8287-8d8a5a749931%22%7d))

We also meet out-of-band with collaborators at "use case" meetings. If you have specific goals for generating evidence using place-based data in conjunction with OMOP data, weâ€™d love to work with you. Please see our page on [proposing new use cases](gi-propose-usecase.html).

## **GIS Toolchain**

The GIS toolchain consists of extensions to the OMOP schema, extensions to the OMOP Vocabulary, and GIS-specific software for acquiring and working with geospatial data. Together, these enable researchers to use health-related attributes of the regions where patients live in OHDSI study cohort definitions. For example, you can use the GIS toolchain to define cohorts that include regional data on exposure to toxicants or social deprivation along with EHR data on relevant health outcomes. The toolchain also includes informatics resources that support integration with the main OHDSI tool stack (HADES) and integration with externally supported solutions for geocoding and for finding and deriving relevant data sources from catalogs of available data sources.

Importantly, the toolchain allows integrated analysis of geospatial and EHR data without sharing any sensitive patient location data.

### OMOP GIS schema extensions
The External_Exposure table is an extension to the main OMOP schema. It holds data on things that can affect health that are associated with the places where patients live. The Location_History table contains information on patient's residence and the dates during which they lived in that location. The DDLs and associated documentation for the External_Exposure table and the Location_History table are [here](schema-extensions.html#location_history) and [here](schema-extensions.html#external_exposure) respectively. The entity-relationship diagram showing the joins between these tables and the main OMOP schema is [here](schema-extensions.html#OMOP_GIS_Schema_Extensions).

### OMOP Vocabulary extensions
The GIS extensions to the OMOP Vocabulary cover geometries, toxicants, and social determinants. They are used to represent a very large set of entities that can affect health and their relationships. The draft versions of these vocabularies are available [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/tree/main/vocabularies). They are based on mature existing ontologies and were developed by GIS workgroup members who are part of the OHDSI Core Vocabulary team in accordance with the guiding principles for OMOP vocabulary development, quality assurance, and integration. Current work on their validation in real use cases is expected to support their eventual acceptance as versioned community-maintained extensions of the core OMOP Vocabulary.

### gaiaCore
The gaiaCore software and associated gaiaDB schema support specification of attributes and geographic shapes in publicly available datasets. This specification allows the tables in the GIS schema extension to be joined with patient-level clinical data stored in the main OMOP schema. The current Beta release of gaiaCore software and its documentation are [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/gaiaCore).

### Guidance
The GIS toolchain requires patient addresses to be geocoded into representations that GIS software expects; for example, the latitude and longitude coordinates of street addresses or the coordinates of the lines that define a postal region. The OHDSI GIS workgroup does not provide or maintain software that does this geocoding. The GIS Workgroup does provide guidance about privacy-preserving options for geocoding address information and considerations for using available open-source and comercial geocoding approaches. The workgroup is also developing guidance to aid researchers in making informed decisions about selecting and working with alternative geospatial data sources that are relevant to addressing a research question.

### Support for integration with OHDSI's technical ecosytem
The GIS Workgroup provides modified versions of the BroadSea container that inlcudes versions of the OHDSI Vocabulary that include draft the GIS vocabularies and the other components of the toolchain. Modified versions of the Tufts Synthetic Data and associated for demonstrating the use of the HADES PLP package to predict incident respiratory conditions using regional air quality data are included in the container.
The workgroup is developing a robust approach to working with available geospatial data sources via catalogs. The approach uses schema.org-compliant standards and federated metadata sharing methods widely used in the GIS community to share information about available datasets.


## **Goals**

The OHDSI GIS Workgroup carries out work in support of its mission by pursuing the following goals:
- Support OHDSI studies that use the GIS toolchain
- Conduct studies that use the GIS toolchain
- Advance the development of the GIS toolchain
- Facilitate the use of externally supported privacy-protecting geocoding software
- Develop data cataloging resources and guidance that enable reuse of specific geospatial datasets in OHDSI studies
