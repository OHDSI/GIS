#**OHDSI Geographic Informations Systems (GIS) Workgroup Homepage**

## **Mission**

The OHDSI GIS workgroup aims to introduce new infrastructure, tooling, and CDM extension tables that will allow researchers to seamlessly incorporate place-based datasets into their OMOP-shaped databases to enhance their evidence-generating workflows.

## **Meeting Schedule**

The GIS General and Development subgroups meet on alternating **Fridays at 9 AM ET**

([General meeting link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3af4d776830f504bf3827fe4309156a3c6%40thread.tacv2/1680892162259?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22a30f0094-9120-4aab-ba4c-e5509023b2d5%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22df92a21b-7fa5-4c86-9f81-9f6ec39e042c%22%7d))

## **Problem Space**

Geospatial data come in a variety of source formats with no universal, interoperable standard representation. While working with a single geospatial dataset has presents some technical challenges, the complexity of using geospatial begins to compound when variables from disparate datasets are needed for a single analysis study. As ad-hoc solutions are introduced to deal with the increasing technical complexity, the reproducibility of these studies plummets. 

In order to enable reproducible studies that incorporate place-related data with longitudinal patient-level data, it is first necessary to develop functionality to automate retrieval and transformation of publicly available place-related data into a standard representation. 

## **Goals**

The overarching goal of the OHDSI GIS Workgroup is to develop software and standards for incorporating place-based data into the OMOP CDM and present this back to the OHDSI community. We reach these goals through development in the four key areas below. 

### 1) Infrastructure
- Functional Metadata Catalog
- Harmonized geospatial data model

### 2) Functionality
- Geocoding
- Accessing geospatial datasets

### 3) Vocabulary
- GIS specific concepts
- SDoH vocabulary
- Toxin vocabulary

### 4) Extensions
- Exposure_occurrence
