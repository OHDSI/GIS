# **Problem Space and Goals**

Geospatial data come in a variety of source formats, with no universal, interoperable standard representation. In order to meet our goal of enabling studies of place-related data in conjunction with longitudinal patient-level data, it is first necessary to develop functionality to automate retrieval and transformation of publicly available place-related data into a standard representation. The GIS workgroup aims to create a suite of tools built around a lightweight "repository of functionality" to incorporate geospatial analyses into the familiar research workflows within the OHDSI ecosystem.

##   **Meeting Schedule**

The GIS General and Development subgroups meet on alternating Fridays at 9 AM ET ([meeting link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a83e90982136c4665aa5f74a6ce292e39%40thread.tacv2/1647286365762?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22a30f0094-9120-4aab-ba4c-e5509023b2d5%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2222effa56-2c2a-408b-9cfd-25cfe976bb49%22%7d))

General meetings focus on use cases, integration with OHDSI tools, and larger project context. Development meetings provide a time for software developers to collaborate or share their recent work.

We encourage folks with an interest in leveraging Place-related data in their research to join or collaborate with the GIS workgroup. While anyone is welcome to join either of the meetings, consider attending the subgroup meeting that best aligns with your goals: If you would like to propose a use case, contribute domain expertise, or learn how the work from this group could augment your current research, consider joining us at a General meeting. If you are interested in contributing to this project on the technical side (code, documentation, unit testing) consider joining us at a Development meeting.

## **Roadmap**

## **Get Involved**

The first iteration of our **gaia** software and variable library is now functional! See the [installation](https://ohdsi.github.io/GIS/installation.html) page to get started  with the gaiaCore R package and gaiaDB database. From there, feel free to build your own tools that interface with gaiaDB and enhance the collection of datasets by adding your own (see TODO). We encourage anyone who adds data sources to a local gaiaDB instance to also create a pull request for them to be added to the full gaiaDB.

You can also request that a data source be added to gaiaDB by filling out a data source request form [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=data+request&template=data_request_template.yaml&title=%5BData+Source+Request%5D%3A+)


Note: For the time being, all software and data sources are still in active development, subject to unannounced changes, and should be considered "unstable". There is currently no versioning of software or data sources, though there are thoughts to implement Semantic Versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) and Universally Unique Identifiers ([UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier))
