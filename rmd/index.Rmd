#**OHDSI Geographic Informations Systems (GIS) Workgroup Homepage**

## **Mission**

The OHDSI GIS workgroup aims to introduce new infrastructure, tooling, and CDM extension tables that will allow researchers to seamlessly incorporate place-based datasets into their OMOP-shaped databases to enhance their evidence-generating workflows.

## **Meeting Schedule**

The OHDSI GIS Workgroup meets weekly on **Fridays at 10 AM ET** ([Meeting Link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3af4d776830f504bf3827fe4309156a3c6%40thread.tacv2/1724707871947?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22a30f0094-9120-4aab-ba4c-e5509023b2d5%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22457ee911-94c1-4da2-8287-8d8a5a749931%22%7d))

We also meet out-of-band with collaborators at "use case" meetings. If you have specific goals for generating evidence using place-based data in conjunction with OMOP data, weâ€™d love to work with you. Please see our page on [proposing new use cases](gi-propose-usecase.html).

## **Problem Space**

Geospatial data come in a variety of source formats with no universal, interoperable standard representation. While working with a single geospatial dataset has presents some technical challenges, the complexity of using geospatial begins to compound when variables from disparate datasets are needed for a single analysis study. As ad-hoc solutions are introduced to deal with the increasing technical complexity, the reproducibility of these studies plummets. 

In order to enable reproducible studies that incorporate place-related data with longitudinal patient-level data, it is first necessary to develop functionality to automate retrieval and transformation of publicly available place-related data into a standard representation. 

## **Goals**

The overarching goal of the OHDSI GIS Workgroup is to develop software and standards for incorporating place-based data into the OMOP CDM and present this back to the OHDSI community. We reach these goals through development in the four key areas below. 

### 1) Infrastructure
- Functional Metadata Catalog
- Harmonized geospatial data model

### 2) Functionality
- Geocoding
- Accessing geospatial datasets

### 3) Vocabulary
- GIS specific concepts
- SDoH vocabulary
- Toxin vocabulary

### 4) Extensions
- Exposure_occurrence
