#**Proposing changes to Gaia Data Models**

## Overview

The gaiaDB data model is still in early development. We hope to build a model that suits a wide range of needs, and as such we encourage interested parties to install, use, and provide feedback on the gaiaDB backbone and harmonized data tables. This documentation demonstrates how to create and submit "formal" change requests via pull requests. That said, we always welcome ad-hoc feedback via email or GitHub issue tracker.

The "official" data model at any given time is displayed on the [Data Model](https://ohdsi.github.io/GIS/dataModel.html) page of this website. This model reflects the csv files gaia<version>fieldLevel.csv and gaia<version>tableLevel.csv that are stored at ./inst/csv at the root of the OHDSI GIS WG git repository.These csv files are used as the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) throughout the project, meaning they are referenced in scripts that create the SQL DDL scripts as well as functions in gaiaCore that operate on gaiaDB.

The csv files, and their formatted counterpart on the Data Model page, provide us a clear method proposing changes. Any changes to the data model should be implemented directly (on a fork or branch of the main repository) to csv files. After changes are made to the csv files, the DDLs can be regenerated (see below), the website can be rerendered to reflect these changes (see [here](https://ohdsi.github.io/GIS/documentationEditing.html#Rendering)), a Pull Request can be opened, and a discussion about the changes can begin.

## Generating DDL scripts

The "official" DDL scripts at any given time are stored at ./inst/ddl. The only time these need to be regenerated is when there are changes or proposed changes to the data model. If you just need to implement the DDL in your database, simply run the scripts in that directory against your Postgres database.

To regenerate the DDL scripts, simply run the scripts gaiaCore::writeGaiaDdl(gaiaVersion, outputfolder), gaiaCore::writePrimaryKeys(gaiaVersion, outputfolder), and gaiaCore::writeForeignKeys(gaiaVersion, outputfolder).
