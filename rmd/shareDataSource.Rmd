# **Sharing a Data Source** 

## Motivation

If you have taken the time and effort to add a data source to your own local instance of gaiaDB, consider sharing it back to the rest of OHDSI GIS community. By sharing your data source you effectively reduce the duplication of effort, help to canonize a single "gaia version" of a web-hosted resource and increase the size of the public gaiaDB repository. All of this helps to nourish the OHDSI GIS system of tools and data sources.

## GitHub Pull Request

At this time, the most straightforward way to share your local data source is via a GitHub Pull Request:

  1. The source file for the gaiaDB.backbone.data_source table is on the OHDSI Github [GIS/source](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/tree/main/source). Make sure that your local gaiaDB instance reflects this source when you add data sources locally.
  2. After you have added one or more data sources to your local gaiaDB instance, export the gaiaDB.backbone.data_source table as a CSV file. 
  3. Create a pull request using [this template](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=share_data_source.yaml&title=%5BShare+New+Data+Source%28s%29+Request%5D), attaching the CSV file that should replace the current source csv.
  4. The gaiaDB software maintainers will accept and merge your contributions or reply to your issue with feedback.
