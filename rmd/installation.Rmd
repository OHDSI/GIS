## gaiaCore R package

1.  See the instructions [here](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/rSetup.html) for configuring your R environment, including RTools and Java.

2.  You can install the development version of gaiaCore from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

    ``` r
    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("OHDSI/GIS/packages/gaiaCore")
    ```
    
3. `library(GIS)`

## gaiaDB database

gaiaDB is a postgres database with PostGIS installed. If you don't have an existing postgres/PostGIS instance, you can download it [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), or create one in a docker container (see below).

If you already have a Postgres/PostGIS database, skip the Docker section. 

### Creating a Docker Container

1. You will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed. The easiest way to install Docker and Docker Compose is by installing [Docker Desktop]([url](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)).

2. Clone the OHDSI/GIS repository to your computer.

3. From a terminal (Command Prompt or Powershell on Windows), make sure the `init` directory is your working directory.

4. Run command `docker-compose up -d`. This will build a docker image, install the database, load the data and variable sources, and expose the database at port 5432.
- Note: to change the port, open the file `docker-compose.yml` and edit line 10 from `- "5432:5432"` to `- "X:5432"` where `X` is the desired port.

5. You can now connect to the database from R using localhost, port 5432 (if not changed), username "postgres", and password "mysecretpassword"
- Note: to change your password, edit line 13 of the `docker-compose.yml` file. If you've already started the container, you will need to shut down the container (`docker-compose down`), remove the volumes (`docker volume rm gis_pgdata`) and image (`docker rmi gis_postgis`) that were created, and redo step 4 for the password change to take effect.

6. The next section will highlight the steps to connect your PostGIS Docker container to R

## Connecting the Database to R

1. Create the `connectionDetails` object

```
connectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(
  dbms = "postgresql",
  server = "localhost/gaiaDB",
  port = 5432,
  user="postgres",
  password = "mysecretpassword") 
```
- Note: the parameters above assume you did not change any default environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml`file

2. Run the `GIS::initializeDatabase(connectionDetails)` function
