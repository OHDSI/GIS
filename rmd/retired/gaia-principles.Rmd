# **Preface**

<br> 

## Use Case Simplified

<br>

To oversimplify, our goal is to create a mechanism to locally deploy a geospatial database, standardize the representation of place-related data within, and automate the process of populating data into it. 

Consequently, the foundational goals of our design can be summarized as:

- Extensibility
  - Tooling (via a standard data model)
  - Collaborative growth
  - Integration with ontologies
- Automation
  - Data retrieval, standardization, ingestion 
  - Deployment of stack 
- Efficiency
  - Storage design
  - Centralized functional metadata

# **Backbone Schema** 

<br>


## Overview

<br>

There are three distinct portions of our schema:

<br>

- #### Data Source & Variable Metadata
  - contained within **DATA_SOURCE** and **VARIABLE_SOURCE** tables
    - VARIABLE_SOURCE to DATA_SOURCE is a many-to-one relationship
  - both functional and descriptive metadata

<br>


- #### Indexing Tables
  - Contained within **GEOM_INDEX** and **ATTR_INDEX**
  - This provides the functional mapping between the data source and variable definitions to the local place-related data
  - These tables are automatically populated when new data sources are added

<br>


- #### Standardized Place-Related data
  - Contained within **GEOM_*{x}*** and **ATTR_*{x}*** tables (many instances)
  - All place-related data, once ingested, is represented as two tables:
     - Geometries
     - Attributes (of geometries)
  - Each data source is ingested as it's own unique set GEOM and ATTR tables

<br>

## **Metadata Tables**



There are two tables within the 'Metadata' portion of our schema:

1) [DATA_SOURCE](gaia-principles.html#DATA_SOURCE)
2) [VARIABLE_SOURCE](gaia-principles.html#VARIABLE_SOURCE)

<br>

<br>

### DATA_SOURCE

<br>

> For a detailed description see: [Specifications/Backbone/data_source](gaia-datamodels.html#data_source)


- This table contains records that catalog external (or local) web-hosted entities. 
- All source data in gaiaDB must be referenced in this table
- Every record in DATA_SOURCE has it's own UUID
- A DATA_SOURCE record is considered valid when the type of polygon is consistent (e.g. political boundary) and it has a unique combination of {Organization, Organization Set, Dataset Name}
  - If a data source has more than one "granularity" of geometry within (albeit quite rare), we split it up into multiple DATA_SOURCE records accordingly
- This table contains descriptive and functional metadata that is leveraged when:
  - creating the indexing tables
  - downloading and ingesting data sources
  - translating and populating geometry-referenced data into the GEOM_{x} tables
- VARIABLE_SOURCE, GEOM_INDEX and ATTR_INDEX all must persist valid foreign keys to DATA_SOURCE, thus the creation of DATA_SOURCE is the first step of ingestion
- For a given data set, the translation logic for the geometry data is stored within the (DATA_SOURCE).*geom_spec* field. The attributes within a given data source are stored within VARIABLE_SOURCE and the attribute translation logic within (VARIABLE_SOURCE).*attr_spec*





<br>




---

<br>

### VARIABLE_SOURCE

<br>

> For a detailed description see: [Specifications/Backbone/variable_source](gaia-datamodels.html#variable_source)


- The VARIABLE_SOURCE table specifies the identification and translation logic for invidivual variables within a given data source. 
- The relation of VARIABLE_SOURCE to DATA_SOURCE is many-to-one. 
- While DATA_SOURCE contains the functional metadata for translating geometry objects (i.e. DATA_SOURCE.geom_spec), the logic for translating attributes is contained with VARIABLE_SOURCE (i.e. VARIABLE_SOURCE.attr_spec)

##  **Indexing tables** </u>

There are two tables within the 'Metadata' portion of our schema:

1. [GEOM_INDEX](gaia-principles.html#GEOM_INDEX)
2. [ATTR_INDEX](gaia-principles.html#ATTR_INDEX)

<br>

- Both tables are automatically populated by metadata contained within the DATA_SOURCE table. 
- These tables serve as a means to provide functional mapping to standardized place-related data contained in disparate schemas and tables, and, consequently, enables parameterized querying

## **Standardized Place-Related Data**

<br>

### Common Data Model Approach

<br>

The common data model approach has been a widely adopted solution for clinical data, notably for two specific reasons:

  1. **Interoperability**: Data sources are structured the same but stored separately .If data sets are harmonized then distributed research is enabled
  
  2. **Extensibility**:  If the underlying model is static, it serves as a strong foundation to develop stable tooling, and community growth, on top of it
  
<br>
  
- While interoperability and opening the doors for federated research are positives, the main reason for adoption of such an approach is to **enable extensibility in tooling, application, and scaling of data sources**. 
- In the simplest description, our "common data model" can be though of as **geometry objects with affiliated temporal attributes**
- The most significant restructuring that occurs is translating attributes to be represented in a format that is (close to) an **Entity, Attribute, Value (EAV) structure**. While many if not most place-related data sets are represented as "wide" tables, with variance in column naming and structure, we convert these "wide" tables into "EAV" table - similar to a "transpose" function. In doing so, we allow a single standard representation, with static columns, for all attributes and geometries.

<br>


### GEOMETRY and ATTRIBUTE

<br>

- There are two template tables that are used to replicate the same two tables for every data source. 
  - GEOM_TEPLATE & ATTR_TEMPLATE
- The schema and table names are:
  - Determined by fields in the respective row of the DATA_SOURCE table
  - Persisted as mapping within the indexing tables
