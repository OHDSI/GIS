# **Applications**

*GAIA is the suite of software used to work with place-related data in conjunction with an OMOP CDM database*

All applications are in a state of active development. We encourage you to experiment with these tools and anticipate that they will be steadily evolving. We greatly appreciate all bug reports, feature request, and general comments, which can all be submitted through the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

Please don't hesitate to reach out to **zollovenecek[at]ohdsi[dot]org** via email or the OHDSI Microsoft Teams tenant if you need assistance setting up a working or development environment for these tools.

## **gaiaDB**

## **gaiaCore**
This R package provides functionality for instantiating and interacting with a gaiaDB instance.

## **gaiaSourceCreator**
This R Shiny app provides a form-based front end for creating new data_source or variable_source records for gaiaDB.
