# **gaiaCore**

## Description

gaiaCore is a **multi-language connector framework** providing programmatic access to gaiaDb functionality. It serves as an access layer, orchestrating SQL functions and protocols defined within gaiaDb across multiple programming languages and access paradigms.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API access** via PostgREST with OpenAPI specification
- **Direct database connections** for SQL-based workflows
- **Language-specific client libraries** (R, Python, and more in development)
- **Multi-paradigm support** for both API and database access patterns
- **Zero processing logic** - all data operations performed in gaiaDb

## Architecture

gaiaCore acts as a thin access layer that:
- Routes requests to appropriate gaiaDb functions
- Provides convenient language-specific abstractions
- Handles authentication and connection management
- Does NOT contain data processing or transformation logic

## Development Status

Active development is occurring at [TuftsCTSI/gaiaCore](https://github.com/TuftsCTSI/gaiaCore), with plans to migrate to [OHDSI/gaiaCore](https://github.com/OHDSI/gaiaCore) upon reaching production readiness.

## Usage

Access gaiaDb through gaiaCore using your preferred language:
- **R**: Client library (in development)
- **Python**: Client library (in development)
- **REST API**: Direct HTTP requests to PostgREST endpoint
- **SQL**: Standard PostgreSQL connections
