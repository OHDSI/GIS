# **Problem Space**

Geospatial data come in a variety of source formats with no universal, interoperable standard representation. While working with a single geospatial dataset has presents some technical challenges, the complexity of using geospatial begins to compound when variables from disparate datasets are needed for a single analysis study. As ad-hoc solutions are introduced to deal with the increasing technical complexity, the reproducibility of these studies plummets. 

In order to enable reproducible studies that incorporate place-related data with longitudinal patient-level data, it is first necessary to develop functionality to automate retrieval and transformation of publicly available place-related data into a standard representation. 

# **Goals**

The overarching goal of the OHDSI GIS Workgroup is to develop software and standards for incorporating place-based data into the OMOP CDM and present this back to the OHDSI community. We reach these goals through development in the four key areas below. 

### 1) Infrastructure
- Functional Metadata Catalog
- Harmonized geospatial data model

### 2) Functionality
- Geocoding
- Accessing geospatial datasets

### 3) Vocabulary
- GIS specific concepts
- SDoH vocabulary
- Toxin vocabulary

### 4) Extensions
- Exposure_occurrence
