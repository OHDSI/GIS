data_source,gaia,Yes,,,,,This table contains records that catalog external (or local) web-hosted entities. All source data in gaiaDB must be referenced in this table.,"All records in this table are sources of geospatial data. They can be sources of geometry data, such as point, line, or polygon, or they can be attribute data with an identifier that relates them to geometry data, such as a FIPS code or GEOID.","All sources of data that should be included in gaiaDB must have an entry in this table. Geometry data sources require a ""geom_spec"": a lightweight transformation from the source data to the standardized format, written in R and serialized as JSON."
variable_source,gaia,Yes,,,,,This table contains records that describe the distinct variables in a data source enabling downstream data integrations. All variables from attribute source data must be catalogued in this table.,"All records in this table describe distinct variables from attribute source data. For example, consider a weather dataset that is being added to gaiaDB. First, the entire dataset is catalogued in the data_source table. Then, the distinct variables of that dataset (temperature in fahrenheit, temperature in celsius, inches of rain, wind direction, etc.) each become a single record in this table. All records in this table are related back to their parent source dataset via a foreign key relationship to the data_source table. Many variable_source records can be related to a single data_source record.","Every individual variable from a source dataset must have an entry in this table. Likewise, any source attribute dataset that gets included in the data_source table will likely have many ""children"" in this table. All records in this table contain an ""attr_spec"": a lightweight transformation of a single variable into the standardized table format."
attr_index,gaia,Yes,attr_,,,,A programmatically derived index table of all the attribute source datasets included in the data_source table.,This table can be (re)generated after new entries are added to the data_source table by running the gaiaCore createIndices() function.,Run the createIndices() function to (re)generate this table.
geom_index,gaia,Yes,geom_,,,,A programmatically derived index table of all the geometry source datasets included in the data_source table.,This table can be (re)generated after new entries are added to the data_source table by running the gaiaCore createIndices() function.,Run the createIndices() function to (re)generate this table.
attr_template,gaia,Yes,attr_,,,,This table is a template for the standardized attribute table that get created.,No action necessary. This table must simply exist (with no entries) in the backbone schema.,No action necessary.
geom_template,gaia,Yes,geom_,,,,This table is a template for the standardized geometry tables that get created.,No action necessary. This table must simply exist (with no entries) in the backbone schema.,No action necessary.
geom_omop_location,gaiaOhdsi,No,,,,,"This table contains identifier and text address from OMOP Location table records along with their associated geocoded, point geometry.",Populate this table from the OMOP Location table to facilitate creation of CDM Extension tables.,Use the geocodeAddresses() function as outlined in https://ohdsi.github.io/GIS/ht-geocode.html
omop_location_history,gaiaOhdsi,No,,,,,This table is a copy of the OMOP Location_History table.,Copy the OMOP Location_History table to Gaia to facilitate creation of CDM Extension tables,This table should be an exact duplicate of the OMOP Location_History table.
exposure_occurrence,gaiaResults,No,exposure_,,,,This CDM Extension table is used to represent person-related transformations of data from Gaia and to interface with ATLAS and OHDSI tool stack from an OMOP CDM database.,,
