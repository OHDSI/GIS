The OMOP GIS Vocabulary Package and its associated CDM extensions are developed iteratively in response to real-world research needs. This section inventories active and proposed **use cases** that drive the evolution of the GIS toolchain, including vocabulary enrichment, CDM schema extensions, analytical methods, and infrastructure improvements.

Each use case represents a specific research question, population health initiative, or analytical workflow that requires geospatial, environmental, or sociodemographic data integration within the OMOP framework.

## 7.1. Role of Use Cases in Toolchain Development

Use cases serve multiple functions within the GIS Working Group ecosystem:

### 7.1.1. Vocabulary Development

Use cases identify:
- **Missing concepts** not currently represented in GIS vocabularies
- **Mapping gaps** where source data lacks standardized OMOP equivalents
- **Hierarchical needs** for aggregating or disaggregating spatial or environmental variables
- **Synonym requirements** to improve discoverability of domain-specific terminology

**Example:** A childhood asthma study requiring fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure data at the Census tract level identified the need for granular air quality concepts and temporal aggregation indicators.

### 7.1.2. CDM Extension Priorities

Use cases inform:
- **Auxiliary table design** for specialized analytical needs (e.g., time-series exposure modeling)
- **Field additions** to `external_exposure` or related tables
- **Index and performance optimizations** for large-scale spatial queries
- **Data linkage patterns** between OMOP clinical data and external geospatial sources

**Example:** A life-course epidemiology study tracking residential mobility and environmental exposures over decades motivated the development of temporal location history extensions.

### 7.1.3. Analytical Method Development

Use cases drive:
- **HADES package enhancements** for spatial statistics and environmental epidemiology
- **Custom R/Python libraries** for geospatial data processing and visualization
- **Federated analysis protocols** for privacy-preserving spatial analyses across networks
- **Validation frameworks** for assessing exposure measurement quality

**Example:** A multi-site study of socioeconomic determinants of health outcomes required development of federated spatial regression methods compatible with OHDSI network study protocols.

## 7.3. Use Case Contributions to the Toolchain

Each use case contributes to one or more components of the GIS toolchain:

### 7.3.1. Vocabulary Enrichment

- Hierarchical relationships for pollutant subcategories

### 7.3.2. CDM Schema Validation

**UC-002 (Social Vulnerability and COVID-19)** validated:
- `external_exposure` table design for SVI index integration
- Linkage patterns between Census tract identifiers and OMOP locations
- Support for multi-component indices (SVI themes and overall ranking)
- Temporal alignment of exposure periods with infection episodes

### 7.3.3. Analytical Infrastructure

**UC-004 (Environmental Justice and Cancer Disparities)** proposes:
- HADES extensions for environmental justice metrics
- Co-exposure network construction algorithms
- Federated analysis protocols for sensitive geographic data
- Visualization tools for spatial disparity assessment

## 7.4. Use Case-Driven MVP Roadmap

Future OMOP CDM MVPs will be explicitly tied to validated use case requirements:

### MVP 2: Time-Series Exposure Modeling
**Driven by:** UC-005 (Residential History and CVD), UC-006 (Noise and Mental Health)
**Requirements:**
- Temporal sequence representation for repeated exposures
- Support for moving window aggregations (e.g., 5-year average prior to diagnosis)
- Integration with OMOP observation_period for longitudinal cohorts

### MVP 3: Multi-Level Spatial Aggregation
**Driven by:** UC-007 (Food Deserts and Diabetes), UC-008 (Climate and Heat Illness)
**Requirements:**
- Hierarchical location relationships (tract → county → state)
- Spatial aggregation functions (e.g., population-weighted averages)
- Support for irregular geographic boundaries (school districts, hospital service areas)

### MVP 4: Co-Exposure Network Modeling
**Driven by:** UC-004 (Environmental Justice and Cancer)
**Requirements:**
- Multi-exposure correlation structures
- Joint distribution modeling for concurrent environmental and social factors
- Network-based visualization and analysis tools
