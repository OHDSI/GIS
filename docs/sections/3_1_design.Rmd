The OMOP GIS Ontology utilizes the GIS Vocabulary Package as its foundational layer, which is collaboratively maintained through a Google Spreadsheet system integrated with Google Apps Scripts and GitHub-based automation pipelines. This ontology serves as a semantic scaffold for spatial and contextual reasoning in health data, enabling structured representation and analysis of geographically-linked, environmental, social, and behavioral determinants of health. It also functions as a machine-interpretable layer that supports standardized analytics, ontology-informed feature generation, and federated ETL workflows across distributed data networks.

### 3.1.1. Ontology Definition in Context

In general, an **ontology** is a structured framework for representing knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Ontologies enable formal semantics, reasoning, and integration across diverse datasets by providing consistent definitions and hierarchical structure.

Within the OMOP GIS framework, the ontology performs a similar function - defining and categorizing **geographic features, environmental exposures, social determinants of health, and their interrelationships** - using the language and constraints of the OMOP CDM. It extends the existing OMOP vocabulary model to support location-aware analyses and geospatial semantics without breaking conformance with OMOP's relational architecture.

### 3.1.2. Architecture and Workflow

The GIS Ontology is constructed through the following components and processes:

- **Source Definition Layer**: Concepts and relationships are entered and curated in a structured Google Spreadsheet format. This spreadsheet includes validated fields for source code, concept class, domain, mappings, predicates, and metadata. Collaborative access and semantic protections are enforced using **Google Apps Scripts**, which regulate row-level editability.

- **Version-Controlled Vocabulary Pipeline**: Approved concepts and mappings are automatically synchronized from Google Sheets to GitHub using scheduled Apps Script tasks. This process creates a persistent and auditable version history while simultaneously preparing mapping data for downstream transformation.

- **Ontology Transformation Pipeline**: A GitHub Action orchestrates a multi-step workflow that converts the spreadsheet-based mappings into relational OMOP-compatible vocabulary tables. This includes:
  1. Ingestion of mapping rows into a **PostgreSQL instance** hosted in Azure
  2. **Syntactic validation** of concept fields, metadata, and predicate consistency
  3. **Differencing logic** to detect novel or updated concepts relative to the baseline OMOP vocabularies
  4. **Construction of staging tables**, including new `concept`, `concept_relationship`, and `concept_synonym` records with assigned `concept_id`s in the reserved space (>2,000,000,000)
  5. **Insertion of validated concepts** into constrained tables in a controlled schema
  6. **Export of delta tables** (vocabulary overlays) to GitHub for use in external ETL workflows

Two Azure-hosted components support this automation: a **Container App** acting as a virtual GitHub runner and a **Flexible Postgres Server** that stores the ontology's relational tables. These components ensure that updates can be executed securely and reproducibly.

### 3.1.3. Ontological Table Structure

The ontology is materialized through a suite of relational "delta" tables. Each table mirrors a specific component of the OMOP vocabulary schema, while systematically extending it to accommodate geospatial logic, including location-referenced features, environmental indices, and spatially-resolved determinants. For example:

- `concept_delta.csv`: Defines both standard and non-standard GIS concepts, including representatives of new domains like `Geographic Feature`, `Environmental Feature`, and `Socioeconomic Feature`.
- `concept_relationship_delta.csv`: Encodes semantic links using relationships such as `Has geometry`, `Affects biostructure`, and `Locates in cell`, facilitating ontology-driven inferences.
- `concept_ancestor_delta.csv`: Reconstructs hierarchical ancestry for reasoning across spatial or categorical groupings.
- `concept_synonym_delta.csv`: Includes synonyms to support flexible querying across GIS, public health, and environmental terminology variants.

This table set collectively reproduces an **ontological graph** within a relational schema, enabling semantic linkage between OMOP-standard concepts and domain-specific enhancements required for contextualized health research.

### 3.1.4. Summary

The OMOP GIS Ontology integrates community-based term curation, semantic standardization via SSSOM predicates, and automated deployment pipelines to construct a modular, versioned vocabulary system. This infrastructure supports not only geospatial analysis but also cross-domain reasoning on determinants of health, exposures, and environment. It positions the OMOP CDM for expanded utility in real-world evidence generation that incorporates place, population context, and environmental burden.
