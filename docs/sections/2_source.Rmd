The OMOP GIS Vocabulary Package is built and maintained through a structured [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMLjKokFCpoDqC_WsAd7ZXyBKDmnPif2rR9DlQ9X7cs/edit?usp=sharing) that supports collaborative editing, centralized curation, and version control. This spreadsheet functions as the backbone of the vocabulary development process, enabling distributed subject-matter experts, curators, and developers to participate in real-time. It is composed of multiple interrelated tabs that each fulfill a specialized role in the construction of a standardized, computable terminology layer.

## 2.1. Overview of Source Spreadsheet Components

The structure adheres to the principles of transparency, auditability, and semantic alignment with the OMOP CDM. The spreadsheet is logically organized into several functional layers:

### 2.1.1. Source Terms Layer

Captures raw terminology originating from environmental, geographic, exposomic, or socio-behavioral data sources. Each record includes a unique source code, human-readable description, vocabulary ID, domain assignment, concept class identifier, and provenance information such as date of review, expert attribution, ORCID ID, and review status.

### 2.1.2. Mapping Layer

Establishes the semantic correspondences between the collected source terms and OMOP standard concepts. Each mapping contains:

- A relationship type (e.g., `Maps to`, `Is a`)
- A predicate aligned with [SSSOM](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/) (e.g., `skos:exactMatch`, `skos:narrowMatch`, `skos:broadMatch`, `skos:relatedMatch`)
- An author-assigned confidence score (0.0–1.0)
- Metadata for mapping validation, status, and reviewer feedback (if exists)

### 2.1.3. Hierarchy Layer

Supports parent-child relationships among concepts and extends the OMOP CDM’s ontology-like capabilities. This is particularly important for representing aggregate social constructs (e.g., Area Deprivation Index) and nested features.

### 2.1.4. Semantic Extensions Layer

Defines custom **Domains**, **Concept Classes**, **Vocabularies**, and **Relationships** that expand the CDM’s expressivity in the context of real-world data. These extensions are consistently registered and versioned (e.g., `OMOP GIS || 20250424`).

Each term progresses through a structured lifecycle: initial entry, expert validation, decision logging, and integration readiness. Fields such as `change_required`, `author_comment`, and `status` support prioritization and triage workflows.

## 2.2. Alignment with SSSOM

The mapping layer leverages SSSOM-style predicates, enabling:

- **Semantic Precision**: Mappings clearly define relationship types for improved analytic reliability
- **Bidirectional Navigation**: Reverse mappings (e.g., `Is geometry of` ↔ `Has geometry`) support symmetric reasoning
- **Crosswalk Potential**: Mappings bridge environmental, clinical, and social data sources for integrated analysis

## 2.3. Automation and Deployment

Google Apps Script automates the parsing, change detection, and transformation of the spreadsheet into [vocabulary delta tables](https://github.com/TuftsCTSI/CVB/tree/main/GIS/Ontology) consumable by OMOP ETL workflows. This enables continuous deployment of vocabulary updates without manual intervention. Extensions are serialized into OMOP-compatible formats and managed according to OHDSI governance protocols.

##  2.4. Contribution Workflow

The spreadsheet functions as both a collaborative workspace and a vocabulary staging environment. Contributors may propose new terms or mappings by adding rows to designated tabs. Each entry is subject to transparent peer review, with review states tracked via controlled values. Reviewers are encouraged to document decisions with ORCID and institutional affiliation.
