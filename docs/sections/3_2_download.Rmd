The OMOP GIS Ontology can be integrated into a local OMOP CDM instance by combining standard vocabulary files obtained from [Athena OHDSI](http://athena.ohdsi.org) with curated delta tables provided via GitHub. This integration enables structured support for spatial, environmental, and contextual reasoning through GIS-aligned concepts and relationships, while preserving OMOP CDM conformance. The process leverages relational structures familiar to OMOP implementers and is compatible with federated ETL workflows and AI-driven pipelines.

### 3.2.1. Required Tools and Access

To begin the installation, ensure you have:

- An Athena OHDSI account to download standard vocabularies.
- SQL client (e.g., DBeaver, pgAdmin) with write access to the OMOP CDM vocabulary schema.
- Access to a PostgreSQL-compatible OMOP instance.
- GIS delta files from [Tufts CTSI GitHub](https://github.com/TuftsCTSI/CVB/tree/main/GIS/Ontology).
- Basic familiarity with OMOP CDM vocabulary architecture.
- **A dedicated development schema** (e.g., `dev_gis`) separate from your production environment, to safely test integration and validate results before promotion.


### 3.2.2. Workspace Preparation

Your OMOP schema must contain all required core tables:

- `concept`, `concept_ancestor`, `concept_class`, `concept_relationship`, `concept_synonym`
- `domain`, `relationship`, `vocabulary`, `drug_strength`

If missing, create them using the [OMOP CDM DDL](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/blob/master/working/DevV5_DDL.sql).

To prepare for GIS enrichment, create delta tables via:

- [`create_delta_tables.sql`](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/blob/main/rmd/data/create_delta_tables.sql)

### 3.2.3. Download Standard OMOP Vocabularies (Athena)

> **All vocabularies listed below are mandatory. Do not skip any.**  
> These vocabularies are referenced in the delta tables and are essential for resolving mappings and relationships. Partial ingestion will result in structural or referential integrity errors.

Select the following **vocabularies** from [Athena OHDSI Download](https://athena.ohdsi.org/vocabulary/list) section, ensuring any license-restricted vocabularies (e.g., **CPT4**) are only selected if your organization holds a valid license:

| Required Vocabulary |
|---------------------|
| ATC |
| CPT4* |
| HCPCS |
| ICD10CM |
| LOINC |
| Nebraska Lexicon |
| OMOP Extension |
| OSM |
| PPI |
| RxNorm |
| RxNorm Extension |
| SNOMED |
| UK Biobank |

After selecting the vocabularies, click **Download Vocabularies**, name the bundle, and download the resulting ZIP file directly from the Athena website once it is ready. Unzip the archive and confirm that the following files are present:

| Expected File |
|---------------|
| CONCEPT.csv |
| CONCEPT_ANCESTOR.csv |
| CONCEPT_CLASS.csv |
| CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP.csv |
| CONCEPT_SYNONYM.csv |
| DOMAIN.csv |
| DRUG_STRENGTH.csv |
| RELATIONSHIP.csv |
| VOCABULARY.csv |


### 3.2.4. Download GIS Delta Tables

Download the `delta tables` from the [GIS Vocabulary GitHub repository](https://github.com/TuftsCTSI/CVB/tree/main/GIS/Ontology). These include:

| Delta Table               |
|---------------------------|
| CONCEPT_DELTA.CSV         |
| CONCEPT_ANCESTOR_DELTA.CSV|
| CONCEPT_CLASS_DELTA.CSV   |
| CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP_DELTA.CSV |
| CONCEPT_SYNONYM_DELTA.CSV |
| DOMAIN_DELTA.CSV          |
| RELATIONSHIP_DELTA.CSV    |
| VOCABULARY_DELTA.CSV      |
| MAPPING_METADATA.CSV      |
| SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP.CSV |

> **Note:** Files such as `restore.sql` and `update_log.csv` are not required for ingestion.

### 3.2.5. Ingest Standard Vocabularies (Athena → OMOP)

Import all downloaded Athena `.csv` files into the corresponding OMOP vocabulary tables using your preferred SQL client.

> **Recommended tools:** Use PostgreSQL `COPY` command via `psql`, or GUI tools such as DBeaver or pgAdmin for loading the files.

> **Important formatting requirements:**
> - Files must use **UTF-8** character encoding.
> - **Comma** should be used as the delimiter.
> - Text fields should be **enclosed in double quotes**.

Match the CSV files to OMOP tables as follows:

| CSV File                   | → OMOP Table         |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| CONCEPT.csv               | → CONCEPT            |
| CONCEPT_ANCESTOR.csv      | → CONCEPT_ANCESTOR   |
| CONCEPT_CLASS.csv         | → CONCEPT_CLASS      |
| CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP.csv  | → CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP |
| CONCEPT_SYNONYM.csv       | → CONCEPT_SYNONYM    |
| DOMAIN.csv                | → DOMAIN             |
| DRUG_STRENGTH.csv         | → DRUG_STRENGTH      |
| RELATIONSHIP.csv          | → RELATIONSHIP       |
| VOCABULARY.csv            | → VOCABULARY         |

After upload, run QA checks.

### 3.2.6. Ingest GIS Delta Content

Insert delta rows into the already existing tables using:
- [`insert_delta_tables_into_omop.sql`](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/blob/main/rmd/data/insert_delta_tables_into_omop.sql)

### 3.2.7. Integrate GIS Delta Tables Into Basic OMOP Vocabulary Tables

This step inserts data from the GIS delta files into the corresponding OMOP vocabulary tables. The mapping between each delta file and its target table is shown below:

| Delta File                   | → Target Table          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| concept_delta.csv           | → CONCEPT               |
| concept_ancestor_delta.csv  | → CONCEPT_ANCESTOR      |
| concept_class_delta.csv     | → CONCEPT_CLASS         |
| concept_relationship_delta.csv | → CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP |
| concept_synonym_delta.csv   | → CONCEPT_SYNONYM       |
| domain_delta.csv            | → DOMAIN                |
| relationship_delta.csv      | → RELATIONSHIP          |
| vocabulary_delta.csv        | → VOCABULARY            |
| mapping_metadata.csv        | → MAPPING_METADATA      |
| source_to_concept_map.csv   | → SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP |

> **Important:** Always validate your integration in a development schema before applying changes to a production vocabulary schema. Ensure referential integrity and uniqueness constraints are preserved.

### 3.2.8. Validate Integration

Use [check_delta_tables_inserts.sql](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS/blob/main/rmd/data/check_delta_tables_inserts.sql) to verify the successful application of the delta content. This includes validation of record counts, relationship integrity, and domain coverage.

### 3.2.9. Outcome

After completing this workflow, your OMOP CDM instance will:

- Contain both standard and GIS-extended vocabularies.
- Support population of `EXTERNAL_EXPOSURE` and `SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP` tables.
- Enable structured representation of spatial and environmental health data.
- Be interoperable with OHDSI tools, federated queries, and AI pipelines.

Use information in the Vocabulary QA section to confirm completeness and correctness of the loaded data.
